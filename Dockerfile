# We fetch and build a specific unreleased version of HLint as well,
# since a version of HLint with SARIF support has not been released yet.
#
# Once one has been, we may either continue to bundle the hlint binary
# together but at a more stable and official set of versions.
# Alternatively, we could have the action retrieve an hlint release
# automatically if one is not already available locally in the action.
