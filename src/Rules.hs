-- Description: Add rules for GitHub.
-- Copyright: Copyright 2023 Google LLC
-- License: Apache-2.0
-- Maintainer: chungyc@google.com
--
-- At the time of writing, HLint does not add a separate @rules@ object
-- because there is not much that it would add that is not already in the results.
-- However, GitHub would use it for the title of a code scanning issue if available,
-- which is frequently better than using the entire message when it is not available.
--
-- This module adds a @rules@ object to SARIF output if it does not already exist.
-- It will use the rule ID as the name of the rule,
-- which GitHub will use as the title of an issue.
--
-- It would have been nice to include the notes in full descriptions.
-- However, we should not because there can be multiple hints
-- with the same name but different notes.

-- | If a @sarifLog@ object does not have a @rules@ object
