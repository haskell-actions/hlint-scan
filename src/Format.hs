-- Copyright: Copyright 2023 Google LLC

--
-- Format message text in result objects for GitHub.
--
-- GitHub only supports the `text` property in a `message` object inside a `result` object.
-- It does not support other properties such as `markdown`.
-- Theoretically this means that GitHub should only be able to render messages
-- as pure text, which is unfortunate because it doesn't actually do so
-- and ignores spaces at the beginning of lines, which makes messages
-- much less readable.
--
-- On the flip side, the reason it ignores spaces in the beginning is
-- GitHub renders the messages with Markdown, although unfortunately it
-- renders a restricted and /undocumented/ subset of the full Markdown syntax.
--
-- SARIF output from HLint should support tools in general,
-- so it would not be appropriate for HLint to add Markdown formatting
-- to the text messages.  Instead, this module will rewrite the text messages
-- to add formatting to make them easier to read, since this program
-- is specialized for uploading SARIF files to GitHub.

import Data.Aeson
import Data.Aeson.KeyMap hiding (map)
import Data.Text qualified as Text

-- | Format text messages in result objects to be better readable on GitHub.

-- | Formats the text in a @message@ object better for GitHub.

-- Basically rewrites the text so that GitHub does not turn the message
-- into mindlessly left-aligned lines of text.  The specific rewriting
-- was derived by trial and error; there appears to be no documentation
-- as to what parts of Markdown syntax are effective in this context,
-- unfortunately.

    -- the suggested replacements, and any notes.
    -- The extra line is inserted as "  " instead of ""
    -- because GitHub would otherwise collapse them.
