# Code scanning with HLint

This is a GitHub action which scans Haskell code using [HLint]
and uploads its suggested improvements to [GitHub code scanning].
It can serve as a status check for pull requests,
with any issues detected being reported.

## Usage

A minimal example for setting up code scanning with HLint:

```yaml
on: [push]

jobs:
  scan:
    name: Scan code with HLint
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      # Needed to upload results to GitHub code scanning.
      security-events: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: haskell-actions/hlint-scan@v0
```

### Inputs

None of the inputs are required.
You only need to set them if the defaults do not work for your situation.

`binary`
:   Path to the hlint binary.

`path`
:   Path of file or directory that HLint will be told to scan.

<!--
Uncomment this when this is ready to be released:

`hints`
:   Path for HLint configuration file.
-->

`category`
:   String used by GitHub code scanning for matching the analyses.

### Outputs

`sarif-id`
:   The ID of the uploaded SARIF file.
