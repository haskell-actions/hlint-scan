# Code scanning with HLint

This is a GitHub action which scans Haskell code using [HLint]
and uploads its suggested improvements to [GitHub code scanning].

## Usage

A minimal example for setting up code scanning with HLint:

```yaml
name: Scan code with HLint
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  hlint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      # Needed to upload results to GitHub code scanning.
      security-events: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: haskell-actions/hlint-scan@v1
```

The action needs [write permission for `security-events`] to upload
the analysis results to GitHub.

If you would like to use this as a [status check] which would prevent pull requests
from being merged until an issue is resolved, you can [adjust the alert severity]
for which code scanning will trigger a failed check.

### Inputs

None of the inputs are required.
You only need to set them if the defaults do not work for your situation.

#### `binary`

Path to the hlint binary.

#### `path`

Path of file or directory that HLint will be told to scan.
Multiple paths can be specified, delimited by whitespace.

#### `hints`

Path for [HLint configuration file].

#### `category`

[Category] distinguishing multiple analyses at the same commit.

### Outputs

#### `sarif-id`

The ID of the uploaded SARIF file.

## Examples

When scanning code with HLint on pushes, issues will show up in
the "Code scanning" dashboard in the "Security" section:

When scanning code with HLint in a pull request, issues with the change
will be reported in the pull request:
